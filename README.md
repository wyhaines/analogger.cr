# analogger

Analogger is an asynchronous client/server log aggregation tool. It was originally
written in Ruby in 2007. This is a Crystal Language port of it. Work is being done
concurrently with the [Ruby version](https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger) to switch it to using msgpack for it's base
data transfer protocol, and to ensure that the Crystal and the Ruby versions have
compatibility in both function and features.
